# StudyNotion-Backend

This repository is the backend of *StudyNotion*. StudyNotion is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB as the primary database.

## Features and Functionalities of the Back-end:

1. User authentication and authorization: Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and password. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
2. Course management: Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.
3. Payment Integration: Students will purchase and enrol on courses by completing the checkout flow that is followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.
4. Cloud-based media management: StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.
5. Markdown formatting: Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, which allows for easier display and rendering on the front end.
